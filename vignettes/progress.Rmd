This document discusses the structure and simplest uses of the cli
progress bar API. For more advanced usage and the C progress bar API, see
the 'Advanced cli progress bars' article and the manual pages.

From version 3.0.0 cli provides a set of functions to create progress bars.
The main goals of the progress bar API are:

* Reduce clutter. Try to avoid verbose syntax, unless necessary.
* Flexibility from R and C/C++ code. Support all cli features in progress
  bars: glue interpolation, theming, pluralization, etc.
* Predictably small performance penalty. A very small constant penalty
  per iteration, and a reasonable penalty per second.

# The traditional progress bar API

Add a progress bar in three steps:

1. Call `cli_progress_bar()` to add create a progress bar.
2. Call `cli_progress_update()` to update it.
3. Call `cli_progress_done()` to terminate it.

For example:

```{asciicast}
#| label: classic-example
#| fig-alt: "Progress bar, that contains, from left to right, the specified label, the bar with green squares, the progress percentage, and the ETA."
clean <- function() {
  cli_progress_bar("Cleaning data", total = 100)
  for (i in 1:100) {
    Sys.sleep(5/100)
    cli_progress_update()
  }
  cli_progress_done()
}
clean()
```

The traditional API provides full control w.r.t when to create, update and
terminate a progress bar.

# The current progress bar

For conciseness, the progress bar functions refer to the _current progress
bar_ by default. Every function has at most one current progress bar at
any time. The current progress bar of a function is terminated when the
function creates another progress bar or when the function returns, errors
or is interrupted.

The current progress bar lets us omit the `cli_progress_done()` call:

```{asciicast}
#| label: current
#| fig-alt: "Two progress bars, after the first finishes, the second starts and then finishes as well."
clean <- function() {
  cli_progress_bar("Cleaning data #1", total = 100)
  for (i in 1:100) {
    Sys.sleep(3/100)
    cli_progress_update()
  }

  cli_progress_bar("Cleaning data #2", total = 100)
  for (i in 1:100) {
    Sys.sleep(3/100)
    cli_progress_update()
  }
}
clean()
```

# Unknown total number of units

In some cases the total number of progress units is unknown, so simply
omit them from `cli_progress_bar()` (or set them to `NA`). cli uses a
different display when `total` is unknown:

```{asciicast}
#| label: unknown-total-seed
#| include: false
#| cache: false
set.seed(1)
```

```{asciicast}
#| label: unknown-total
#| fig-alt: "Example progress bar where the total number of units is unknown. It has a spinner, the specified label, shows how many units are done, how many units are completed per second and the elapsed time."
walk_dirs <- function() {
  cli_progress_bar("Walking directories")
  while (TRUE) {
    if (runif(1) < 0.01) break
    Sys.sleep(0.01)
    cli_progress_update()
  }
  cli_progress_update(force = TRUE)
}
walk_dirs()
```

# Quick loops

By default, cli does not show progress bars that are terminated within two
seconds after their creation. The end user can configure this limit
with the `cli.progress_show_after` global option.

For example, in this document we set the limit to zero seconds, so progress
bars are shown at their first update.

# Progress bars for mapping functions: `cli_progress_along()`

`cli_progress_along()` is currently experimental.

To add a progress bar to a call to `lapply()` or another mapping function,
wrap the input sequence into `cli_progress_along()`:

```r
lapply(cli_progress_along(X), fun)
```

`cli_progress_along()` works similarly to `seq_along()`, it returns an index vector.
If you use `cli_progress_along()`, then `lapply()` will pass the _indices_
of the elements in `X` to `fun`, instead of the elements themselves.

`cli_progress_along()` expects that the index vector will be used only once,
from beginning to end. It is best to never assign the return value of
`cli_progress_along()` to a variable.

An example:

```{asciicast}
#| label: tickalong
#| fig-alt: "Progress bar with green squares, that also shows the progress percentage and the ETA."
f <- function() {
  rawabc <- lapply(
    cli_progress_along(letters),
    function(i) {
      charToRaw(letters[i])
      Sys.sleep(0.5)
    }
  )
}
f()
```

`cli_progress_along()` uses ALTREP, so it only works from R 3.5.0 and later.
On older R versions it is equivalent to `seq_along()` and it does not
create a progress bar.

## `for` loops

You can also use `cli_progress_along()` in `for` loops, with the additional
complication that if you use `break`, then you might need to terminate the
progress bar explicitly:

```r
for (i in cli_progress_along(seq)) {
  ...
  if (cond) cli_progress_done() && break
  ...
}
```

`cli_progress_done()` always returns `TRUE` to allow this form.

Alternatively, you can terminate the progress bar right after loop:

```r
for (i in cli_progress_along(seq)) {
  ...
  if (cond) break
  ...
}
cli_progress_done()
```

If the function containing the `for` loop returns after the loop, or
you create another progress bar with `cli_progress_along()` or `cli_progress_bar()`,
then no explicit `cli_progress_done()` is needed.

# Simplified API

Often you don't need the full power of the progress bar API, and only want
to show a status message. The `cli_progress_message()` and
`cli_progress_step()` functions are tailored for this.

`cli_progress_message()` shows a (potentially templated) message in the
status bar. For convenience, the progress bar rules still apply here by
default:

* Status messages are removed when their calling function exits.
* A status message removes the previous status message or progress bar
  of the same caller function.

```{asciicast}
#| label: cli_progress_message
#| fig-alt: "The three messages are shown, each on its own line, the third one is iterated over 5 steps."
f <- function() {
  cli_progress_message("Task one is running...")
  Sys.sleep(2)

  cli_progress_message("Task two is running...")
  Sys.sleep(2)

  step <- 1L
  cli_progress_message("Task three is underway: step {step}")
  for (step in 1:5) {
    Sys.sleep(0.5)
    cli_progress_update()
  }
}
f()
```

Status messages may use glue interpolation, cli styling and pluralization,
as usual. You can call `cli_progress_update()` to update a status message.

`cli_progress_step()` is slightly different from
`cli_progress_message()`:
* it adds cli's alert themes to the status messages (info, success or
  danger),
* prints the duration of each step (by default), and
* it keeps the messages on the screen after they are terminated.

```{asciicast}
#| label: cli_progress_step_simple
#| fig-alt: "Four progress steps are shown, each on its own line. Each steps show up as an 'i' (info) step first, and stays like that while it is running. When it is done, the 'i' is turned into a tick mark, and the running time of the step is added to the line at the end, in grey."
f <- function() {
  cli_progress_step("Downloading data")
  Sys.sleep(2)

  cli_progress_step("Importing data")
  Sys.sleep(1)

  cli_progress_step("Cleaning data")
  Sys.sleep(2)

  cli_progress_step("Fitting model")
  Sys.sleep(3)
}
f()
```

As usual, you can use `cli_progress_step()` to update an existing status
message.

```{asciicast}
#| label: cli_progress_step
#| fig-alt: "First the 'About to start..'. message is shown in its own line. Then a progress bar starts on the next line. The progress bar takes 10 steps. After the fifth step, the progress bar is overwritten with the 'Already half way!' message and the progress bar is moved down to the third line."
f <- function(n = 10) {
  cli_alert_info("About to start downloads of {n} file{?s}")
  i <- 0
  cli_progress_step("Got {i}/{n} {qty(i)}file{?s}.")
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    Sys.sleep(0.5)
    if (i == 5) cli_alert_info("Already half way!")
    cli_progress_update()
  }
}
f()
```

If you can update the status message frequently enough, then you can also
add a spinner to it:

```{asciicast}
#| label: cli_progress_step_spinner
#| fig-alt: "Four steps are shown, each on its own line. While each step is running, its line has a spinner. Once it is done, the spinner turns into a tick mark and the running time of the step is added to its line at the end."
f <- function() {
  cli_progress_step("Downloading data", spinner = TRUE)
  for (i in 1:100) { cli_progress_update(); Sys.sleep(2/100) }
  cli_progress_step("Importing data", spinner = TRUE)
  for (i in 1:100) { cli_progress_update(); Sys.sleep(1/100) }
  cli_progress_step("Cleaning data", spinner = TRUE)
  for (i in 1:100) { cli_progress_update(); Sys.sleep(2/100) }
  cli_progress_step("Fitting model", spinner = TRUE)
  for (i in 1:100) { cli_progress_update(); Sys.sleep(3/100) }
}
f()
```

`cli_progress_step()` automatically handles errors, and styles the
status message accordingly:

```{asciicast}
#| label: step-error
#| fig-alt: "Two steps are shown, each in its own line. While a step is running its line is an 'i' (info) line. The first step finishes successfully and its 'i' mark is turned into a tick mark. The second step fails with an error and its line is overwritten with the error message, and moved down to the third line, and marked with an 'x' (error) mark."
#| asciicast_rows: 3
f <- function() {
  cli_progress_step("First step, this will succeed")
  Sys.sleep(1)
  cli_progress_step("Second step, this will fail")
  Sys.sleep(1)
  stop("Something is wrong here")
}
f()
```
